                    Systems Thinking is a way to gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. Like Human-Centered Design, it
                    attempts to see past the surface-level, event-based, explanations of behavior to contruct mental
                    models of behavior.
                </p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">We and everyone we'll design for live within complex social, cultural, and
                    institutional systems. Those around is influence what we say, do, see, and believe. </p>
                <p class="main-paragraph"> While the language might sound technical, the theories are inherently human-centered. It focuses on how relationships between and amongst people, behaviors, and environments lead to certian outcomes. In this article, I'll use personal health as an example.
                </p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">While systems thinking help us understand behavior better, only by combining 
                    it with the iterative approaches of design thinking, can we devise better solutions to systemic problems.

                <p class="main-paragraph"> Embracing complexity and nuance is also an important part of both design
                    thinking and systems thinking. These two approaches to problem solving are extremely compatible with
                    each other. Design Thinking excels at helping us discover and address user painpoints. And systems
                    thinking gives us a framework to understand how a user’s behavior is influenced by their history,
                    environment, and current context.
                </p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Both use models to help us make sense of the complexity and give us a glimpse
                    into the user experience that can lead to valuable insights and innovative ideas.

                </p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Many of these ideas around systems thinking are already common in Design
                    Thinking. But by incorporating the language and tools into our work, we can better understand the
                    critical role that feedback and systems play in influence user behavior and experience. </p>

                <p>To give you a better understanding of the necessary parts of a system, I'll use the example of health. Human bodies are extremely complex systems that are adaptable to changes and are greatly influenced by our behavior and environment. </p>
                <p>If we want to be healthier, we can change our diet, exercise, sleep. stress levels, relationships, and so on since they all influence our overall health. To add to the complexity, these behaviors are often connected to each other, so for example getting less sleep may increase stress.</p>
                <p>These interconnections are what make solving systemic problems hard. We often need a holistic approach that inflences all these part, rather than pinpointing a single area to focus on. </p>
